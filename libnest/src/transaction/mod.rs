//! Transactions and ways to notify the user about what happens when they are performed.
//!
//! This module contains a definition of a [`Transaction] in the form of a trait that all transactions
//! implement ([`Pull`], [`Install`], [`Remove`], [`Update`] etc.)
//!
//! It also contains a way to orchestrate multiple transactions so they can be performed in the most efficient way, and a notifier
//! to show the evolution of each one of them.
